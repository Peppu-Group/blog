## Why AI is Important for Educators?

EdTech (Educational Technology) is where technology meets education. This is important because it enhances the way we teach and learn, making education more accessible, personalized, and effective. In the case of Curri AI, teachers not only get personalized and effective lessons for their students, they get them faster, without breaking the bank or even a sweat. Think of Curri AI as your all-in-one education platform where you can create lesson plans, notes, assessments, and even automatically score and rank students. Let's explore how this enhances the educational process.

## How Curri AI x Proctored is Enhancing the Education Process

[Curri AI](https://curri.schoola.app/) allows you to create lesson plans with the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Next, lesson notes can be generated according to the lesson plans. Finally, you can create assessments from these, with a few clicks and prompts describing the lesson path. With [Proctored](https://proctored.peppubuild.com), the lesson path can be propagated across Google Classroom. Also, assessments can be integrated into timed/proctored exams. Teachers can also incorporate a marking scheme and automatically get the score of students when they take the quiz/monitor violations.

## Our Integration Process

Proctored is incorporating with Curri AI to bring an enhanced learning experience into Google Classroom. Teachers can now broadcast lesson plans and coursework into [Classroom](https://developers.google.com/workspace/classroom). To take it further, questions can be moved into Google Forms as a quiz with automatic grading enabled. We plan to do this, utilizing Proctored API, and integrating appropriate buttons in the Curri dashboard to call Google Forms/Classroom APIs.

### Features
- Tailored lesson paths.
- Broadcasting coursework into Google Classroom.
- Quiz generation. 
- Timed quiz/Monitoring.
- Automatic quiz grading.

## Final Thoughts
In this tutorial, we have explored how the Curri AI x Proctored integration promotes and enhances the education process for students and teachers. Plan lessons, create them, and test students, all from the same place with this partnership.
