With the rise in Artificial Intelligence (AI), and no-code tools, it is possible to create functional websites without writing any code. Most No-code tools are equipped with a drag-and-drop feature, that allows users to drag blocks (components) into the workspace. Some of these tools already have templates that the user can search from, and choose the templates (websites), that suits them. In this guide, we will create a website and publish it online, without writing any code.

## Choose a platform
The first step for creating a website without writing any code, is to choose a no-code platform. They're a lot of options in the market currently. Therefore, it is important to choose a platform with features that suits your needs. For instance, it maybe difficult to scale your website or web application due to vendor lock-in. Let us compare some of the popular no-code tools, their pros and cons. 

### Wix
[Wix](https://www.wix.com/) is a website builder, that offers tools for creating HTML5 websites for desktop and mobile platforms. This platform is equipped with drag-and-drop editing capabilities, so that users can edit websites to suite their needs. The Wix interface, is user friendly and responsive across different platforms.

**Pros**
- Wix is user friendly, you don't need to be a developer or expert to create and publish your website with Wix.
- Wix handles domain purchase and setup.

**Cons**
- Wix is expensive, when compared to other platforms.
- It is impossible to get your code artifacts from Wix, you also can't view your code. This contributes to vendor lock-in.

### Webflow
[Webflow](https://webflow.com/) takes visual web development a step further, it allows you to create dynamic websites (display different content, likely from real-time data or database). Unlike other no-code platforms where you get a static website (individual html files that are pre-built and stored in a web server), you can create websites that get content from a database, using Webflow's [CMS (Content Management System)](https://www.optimizely.com/optimization-glossary/content-management-system/#:~:text=A%20content%20management%20system%20(CMS)%20is%20a%20web%20application%20or,of%20templates%20like%20a%20website.).

**Pros**
- CMS for easy data management and dynamic website creation.
- Scale and track performance with SEO (Search Engine Optimization)

**Cons**
- Limited design options and functionality, resulting in vendor lock-in.
- Pricing structure can be confusing, with the availability of different add-ons and plans.
- Webflow isn't optimized for non-developers as CSS class management can be challenging. 

### Carrd
While other platforms are optimized for users to create multi-paged websites, [Carrd](https://carrd.co/) focuses on landing pages. If you want to create a landing page for your SaaS or product, Carrd is easy to set-up.

**Pros**
- Easy to setup, free plans and free templates.
- Add custom domain name for pro plans that are relatively cheaper than other platforms.

**Cons**
- Vendor lock-in, can't scale landing page to corporate website with multiple pages.

### Peppubuild

[Peppubuild](https://peppubuild.com/) is a no-code platform that gives you full access to your code artifacts, eliminating vendor lock-in. It comes with pre-built templates and blocks so that you can build your websites faster. You can download your artifacts, view your code, or publish in one click.

**Pros**
- Free plans and templates available, upgrade when you need to.
- Analytics and optimization with SEO.
- Manage your code artifacts yourself, scale without vendor lock-in.

**Cons**
- Still under development

With this comparison, we'll be using Peppubuild as our platform, since we want full autonomy for our code and the ability to scale later.

## Choose a template
After signing up with Peppubuild, we can create a new website or application by clicking on the **New Project** button. Next, choose the **Build with Template** button, and select the template you like best. In this tutorial, we'll use the **Collaborate** template since it captures the themes we need for our coporate website.

Finally, click on the template, give your project a name and you'll be redirected to the editor workspace.

## Edit website visually
Now that you have the template of your choice open in the editor, you can edit pictures, texts, buttons, forms, and add links. You can add external links (https://www.google.com),internal links (#about) or links to different pages of the website (/about).

The style manager contains options to style your page. Here you can change font size, background color, or add decorations in border radius and box shadow. Once you have edited the website to suite your needs, you can publish in one click.

## Publish website
Click on the pages button and choose **Publish Project** button. Here, you can either choose to publish on Netlify or download code aartifacts.

You can get the full guide of how we built a demo website using webflow on YouTube. Here's a link to the final website here. In the next article, we will add more pages and links.
